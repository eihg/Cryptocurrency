# Cryptocurrency Campaign at Burger King: Earn BTC, ETH, and DOGE with Purchases  

In a groundbreaking marketing move, Burger King has partnered with Robinhood to launch a unique cryptocurrency promotion. This innovative campaign rewards customers with chances to win Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE) when purchasing qualifying meals.  

## Burger King & Robinhood: A Strategic Partnership  

The collaboration between Burger King and Robinhood represents a bold step in mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. Running from November 1 to November 21, the promotion invites U.S. customers to participate through multiple channels:  
- Burger King mobile app  
- Official website  
- Physical restaurant locations  

To qualify, customers need only spend $5 or more on eligible meals. Participants will receive a daily email with a unique entry code, granting them one chance per day to win crypto prizes. Winners must hold a Robinhood account to claim their rewards, emphasizing the platform's role in democratizing digital asset access.  

### Core Cryptocurrency Prizes  

The campaign offers 20 BTC, 200 ETH, and 2 million DOGE, with combined market value exceeding $2.6 million. This tiered prize structure caters to varying levels of crypto interest:  
- **BTC (Bitcoin):** 20 units available  
- **ETH (Ethereum):** 200 units available  
- **DOGE (Dogecoin):** 2 million units available  

While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain established market leaders, Dogecoin's inclusion leverages its meme-based popularity and lower entry barrier for new crypto users.  

## Brand Statement on Crypto Education  

Burger King's initiative extends beyond marketing, positioning itself as a crypto education gateway:  
> "Cryptocurrencies have become a hot topic, but we understand they can be difficult to grasp. Through this campaign, we aim to introduce digital assets in a digestible format our customers can easily engage with."  

This approach aligns with broader corporate strategies to familiarize consumers with blockchain technology through everyday experiences.  

## Prize Distribution Mechanics  

The promotion guarantees every participant receives at least one Dogecoin, ensuring widespread engagement:  
- **BTC probability:** 0.001% per entry  
- **ETH probability:** 0.01% per entry  
- **DOGE guarantee:** All non-BTC/ETH winners receive 1 DOGE
