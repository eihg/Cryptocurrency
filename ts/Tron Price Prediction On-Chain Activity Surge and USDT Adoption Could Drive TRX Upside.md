**Q: How is market capitalization calculated?**  
A: Multiply circulating supply by current price (e.g., 100M TRX Ã— $0.2730 = $27.3M market cap).  

**Q: What drives trading volume surges?**  
A: Increased adoption, exchange listings, or institutional interest typically boost volume across centralized and decentralized platforms.
