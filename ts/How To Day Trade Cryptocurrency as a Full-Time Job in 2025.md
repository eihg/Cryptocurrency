## Understanding Cryptocurrency Day Trading

**Cryptocurrency day trading** involves buying and selling digital assets within a single trading session to capitalize on short-term price fluctuations. Unlike traditional stock markets, crypto markets operate 24/7, offering unique opportunities and challenges. This practice requires a blend of technical analysis, market awareness, and disciplined risk management.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Volatility:** Rapid price movements create profit potential but increase risk
- **Liquidity:** High trading volumes ensure smoother entry/exit points
- **Market Sentiment:** News, social media trends, and macroeconomic factors significantly influence prices

## Risk Management Framework

Implement these critical risk controls:

1. **Position Sizing Formula:**
   ```
   Position Size = (Account Risk % Ã— Account Value) / (Entry Price Ã— Stop Loss Distance)
   ```
   Example: For a $20,000 account risking 1% on a $30,000 BTC trade with 5% stop loss:
   ```
   (0.01 Ã— 20,000) / (30,000 Ã— 0.05) = 1.33 BTC
   ```

2. **Daily Loss Limits:** Cap losses at 3-5% of account value

3. **Risk/Reward Ratios:** Maintain minimum 1:2 for all trades

4. **Portfolio Allocation:**
   - Core positions: 60% BTC/ETH
   - Momentum altcoins: 30%
   - Stablecoins: 10% for quick entries
