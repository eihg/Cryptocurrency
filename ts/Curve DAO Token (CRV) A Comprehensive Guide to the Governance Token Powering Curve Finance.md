# Curve DAO Token (CRV): A Comprehensive Guide to the Governance Token Powering Curve Finance  

## What Is Curve DAO Token (CRV)?  

Curve DAO Token (CRV) is the native governance token of **Curve Finance**, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol designed for efficient stablecoin and token swaps with minimal slippage. Launched on August 13, 2020, CRV serves multiple purposes within the ecosystem, including governance participation, liquidity provider incentives, and fee distribution.  

### Core Functions of CRV  
- **Governance Voting**: Holders can lock CRV to create **veCRV (vote-escrowed CRV)**, which grants voting rights proportional to the amount and duration of locked tokens.  
- **Staking Rewards**: Stakers receive a share of Curveâ€™s trading fees, with 50% allocated to veCRV holders.  
- **Liquidity Boosting**: veCRV holders earn up to **2.5x boosted rewards** on liquidity provision.  
- **Protocol Incentives**: CRV emissions reward liquidity providers across various pools.  

### Key Metrics  
| Metric                | Value                  |  
|-----------------------|------------------------|  
| Max Supply            | 3.03 billion (3.03b)   |  
| Launch Date           | August 13, 2020        |  
| Circulating Supply    | 0 at launch (released gradually) |  
| Distribution Channels | Liquidity providers, shareholders, employees, community reserve |  

## How Curve Finance Works  

Curve Finance, founded by **Michael Egorov** (CTO of NuCypher), operates as an **automated market maker (AMM)** optimized for stablecoins and similar-priced assets. Unlike traditional AMMs like Uniswap, Curveâ€™s algorithm prioritizes **low slippage and fees**, making it ideal for stablecoin swaps.  

### Unique Features of Curve  
- **Pricing Formula**: Minimizes slippage for tokens with pegged values (e.g., DAI, USDC, USDT).  
- **Liquidity Aggregation**: Users can deposit assets into multiple pools (e.g., 3Pool, sUSD, etc.) to earn fees.  
- **veCRV Governance**: Locking CRV for veCRV aligns long-term incentives by tying voting power to token commitment.  

### Example of Curveâ€™s Efficiency  
A trader swapping 1 million USDC to DAI on Curve would experience **~$1 in slippage**, compared to potentially $50+ on a standard AMM.  

## CRV Tokenomics and Distribution  

The total supply of 3.03 billion CRV is distributed as follows:  
- **Community Liquidity Providers**: 62%  
- **Shareholders**: 22%  
- **Employees**: 10%  
- **Community Reserve**: 6%  

Rewards are released linearly over four years, with a **current inflation rate of ~1.7% per year**.  

### Staking Mechanics  
1. **Lock CRV**: Convert CRV to veCRV by locking tokens for up to 4 years.  
2. **Earn Fees**: 50% of daily trading fees are distributed to veCRV holders.  
3. **Boost Liquidity Pools**: veCRV holders receive higher yields on liquidity provision.

- **Revenue Model**: $100M+ in annualized fee revenue, split between veCRV holders and LPs.  
- **Cross-Chain Expansion**: Deployed on Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, and others.  

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
