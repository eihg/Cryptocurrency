## $ATM: Leading the Charge  

Topping the charts with 313,500 XRP ($677,000) in 24-hour trading volume, **$ATM** has solidified its position as XRPL‚Äôs most active meme coin.

### Key Metrics:  
- **Trading Volume (24H)**: 313,500 XRP  
- **Market Cap**: $2.1 million  
- **Unique Feature**: Community-driven decentralization  

## $DONNIE: Gaining Momentum  

Securing second place with 243,440 XRP in daily volume, **$DONNIE** thrives on decentralized liquidity pools. Data from XRPL‚Äôs Automated Market Maker (AMM) infrastructure reveals consistent swaps between $DONNIE and $FUZZY, indicating strong on-chain demand.

The token‚Äôs growth trajectory highlights the symbiotic relationship between meme culture and decentralized finance.  

## $XRPs: Quiet but Rising  

Ranked third with 164,130 XRP in volume, **$XRPs** operates under the radar despite its steady ascent. While lacking mainstream attention, its trading metrics suggest a growing appetite for under-the-radar tokens within the XRPL ecosystem. This meme coin exemplifies how novelty and community engagement can drive value in niche markets.  

### Why $XRPs Stands Out:  
- **Trading Volume (24H)**: 164,130 XRP  
- **Community Focus**: Undocumented grassroots support  
- **Potential**: Untapped growth in decentralized liquidity  

## $ARMY: The Voice of the XRP Community  

With 114,060 XRP in 24-hour volume, **$ARMY** embodies the spirit of the XRP community. Designed as the flagship token of the ‚ÄúXRP Army,‚Äù it incorporates deflationary mechanisms like transaction-based token burns. Over 12,000 holders and a $20 million market cap underscore its long-term viability.  

The token‚Äôs resilience highlights the power of collective ownership in sustaining digital assets.  

## $FUZZY: The Underdog with Energy  

Closing the list at 89,630 XRP in volume, **$FUZZY** proves that accessibility and playful branding can drive engagement. Despite its smaller scale, $FUZZY‚Äôs AMM pair activity demonstrates how newer meme coins can compete through innovative token design and active trader participation.  

## The Expanding XRPL Meme Economy  

Cobb‚Äôs analysis reveals a broader trend: meme coins now account for nearly half of XRPL‚Äôs daily decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, roughly $3 million out of $6 million. Platforms like XPMarket, Sologenic, and First Ledger provide the infrastructure enabling this growth.
