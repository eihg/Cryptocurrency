# 2018 Ethereum Technology and Application Conference in China  

The **2018 Ethereum Technology and Application Conference in China** brought together blockchain enthusiasts, developers, and industry leaders to explore the future of Ethereum technology and its transformative potential across industries. Hosted in Beijing, the event featured insights from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, technical deep dives into scalability solutions like **Casper** and **Sharding**, and a groundbreaking developer survey that mapped the state of Ethereum adoption. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the conference, its key themes, and the implications for blockchain development in 2025 and beyond.  

## Keynote Speeches: Vitalik Buterin and Ethereumâ€™s Future  

### Vitalik Buterin on Casper and Sharding  

Ethereum co-founder **Vitalik Buterin** delivered a pivotal keynote on the platformâ€™s technical roadmap, focusing on **Casper** (a hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake protocol) and **Sharding** (a scalability solution). These technologies aim to address Ethereumâ€™s long-standing challenges: transaction throughput and network congestion.  

Casper, now a cornerstone of Ethereumâ€™s upgrade strategy, was described by Buterin as a critical step toward a fully proof-of-stake (PoS) network. The hybrid protocol (Casper FFG) had already been proposed as Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1011, with plans to transition fully to PoS in subsequent phases. Buterin emphasized that Casper would reduce energy consumption, enhance security, and enable faster transaction finality.  

Sharding, another scalability breakthrough, was highlighted as a method to partition Ethereumâ€™s blockchain into smaller, parallelizable segments. This would drastically increase transaction speeds while lowering costs. Buterin showcased a new codebase demonstrating how shard chains interact with the main Ethereum network, signaling that this technology was nearing implementation.  

### Karl Floersch: Education and the Crypto Economy  

Ethereum Foundation researcher **Karl Floersch** focused on the importance of **crypto economy education**. He outlined Ethereumâ€™s efforts to democratize blockchain knowledge through online courses, books, and open-source resources. Floerschâ€™s presentation covered topics like:  
- **Proof-of-stake mechanics** and attack vectors  
- **Plasma** and Layer 2 scaling solutions  
- **Sharding**â€™s role in decentralized systems  

Floersch stressed that Ethereumâ€™s long-term success hinges on equipping developers with the tools to build secure, scalable applications.

## Technical Deep Dives: Overcoming Ethereumâ€™s Challenges  

### Smart Contract Security and Developer Best Practices  

A recurring theme at the conference was the need to address **smart contract vulnerabilities**. PeckShield CEO **Jiang Xuxian** presented a stark analysis of security risks, noting that 34.6% of surveyed developers had encountered security incidents. Key recommendations included:  
- **Pre-deployment audits** to identify code flaws  
- **Post-deployment monitoring** for runtime threats  
- **Bug bounty programs** to incentivize community-driven security  

### Cross-Chain Interoperability  

CTO **Liu Yang** of Zhonggong Software explored the future of **cross-chain technology**, a critical component for a multi-chain ecosystem. He outlined four primary approaches:  
1. **Notary Schemes** (centralized third-party validation)  
2. **Sidechains/Relays** (bidirectional pegs for asset transfers)  
3. **Hash-Locking** (atomic swaps for trustless exchanges)  
4. **Future-Proof Protocols** (e.g., Polkadotâ€™s Substrate framework)  

Liu emphasized that cross-chain solutions would enable Ethereum to coexist with emerging blockchains while preserving its first-mover advantage.

## The Ethereum Developer Survey: Insights and Trends  

CSDNâ€™s **Ethereum Developer Survey**, which collected data from 413 participants, revealed several trends shaping the ecosystem:  

| **Metric**                | **Percentage** |  
|---------------------------|----------------|  
| Developers actively working on Ethereum | 34.6%          |  
| Developers unfamiliar with Ethereum core tech | 60%            |  
| Developers citing "use case uncertainty" as a challenge | 40%+           |  

The survey underscored a significant knowledge gap, with over half of developers lacking hands-on experience in Ethereum-specific tools like Solidity and Truffle. However, 97.6% of respondents expressed interest in future Ethereum projects, signaling strong long-term potential.  

### Geographical and Demographic Breakdown  

- **Location**: 52% of developers were based in Beijing, reflecting Chinaâ€™s growing blockchain hub.  
- **Industry**: 68% worked in internet/tech sectors, with backend engineers forming the largest group.  
- **Cryptocurrency Adoption**: Only 63% owned digital assets, highlighting Ethereumâ€™s early-stage adoption curve.

## Industry Applications: From Finance to IoT  

### Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Stablecoins  

MakerDAOâ€™s Asia Head **Wang Qijun** discussed the role of **stablecoins** in achieving financial stability. MakerDAOâ€™s DAI, a USD-pegged token, was praised for enabling predictable transactions in volatile markets. Key takeaways included:  
- **Stablecoins as a bridge** between traditional and decentralized finance  
- **Collateralized debt positions (CDPs)** as a risk-mitigation mechanism  

### IoT and Ethereum: Bridging Physical and Digital Worlds  

CLand CTO **Graham Liu** presented a compelling use case for Ethereum in **Internet of Things (IoT)** ecosystems. By leveraging sidechains, IoT devices could securely log data on Ethereum, enabling:  
- **Transparent supply chain tracking**  
- **Automated smart contract execution** for device interactions
