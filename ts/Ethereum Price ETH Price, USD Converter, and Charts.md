# Ethereum Price: ETH Price, USD Converter, and Charts  

The current price of Ethereum (ETH) is **$2,576.74**, with a 24-hour trading volume of **$18.18B**. Ethereum has remained unchanged at **+0.00%** over the past 24 hours, and there are **120.72 million ETH** in circulation.  

## What Is Ethereum?  

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy **smart contracts** and **decentralized applications (DApps)**. Unlike traditional systems requiring intermediaries, Ethereumâ€™s architecture ensures transparency, security, and autonomy. Its native cryptocurrency, **Ether (ETH)**, serves as the fuel for transactions and computational services on the network.  

Ethereumâ€™s Turing-complete programming language allows developers to create programmable agreements (smart contracts) and digital assets. It is the most widely used blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and enterprise solutions.  

### Key Features of Ethereum  
- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing agreements with terms directly written into code.  
- **Decentralized Applications (DApps)**: Applications running on a peer-to-peer network without centralized control.  
- **ERC-20 Standard**: A protocol for creating and issuing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.  
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: A consensus mechanism adopted in 2022 to improve scalability and energy efficiency.

## A Brief History of Ethereum  

Ethereum was conceptualized in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin through a whitepaper proposing a blockchain platform capable of executing smart contracts. This vision addressed the limitations of Bitcoinâ€™s rigid scripting system, offering a flexible environment for developers.  

In 2014, Ethereum raised **$18.3 million** in its initial crowdfunding campaign, marking one of the first major cryptocurrency fundraising efforts. The network officially launched in 2015, introducing a revolutionary framework for decentralized applications.  

### Major Upgrades  
- **The Merge (2022)**: Transitioned Ethereum from energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) to energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS), reducing energy consumption by 99.95%.  
- **EIP-1559 (2021)**: Overhauled transaction fee mechanics to improve predictability and burn a portion of ETH, creating deflationary pressure.  

## How Does Ethereum Work?  

Ethereum operates on a global network of nodes that validate and record transactions. Developers write smart contracts in languages like Solidity, which are then executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Every action on the network requires a fee, paid in ETH, known as **gas fees**.  

### Gas Fees Explained  
Gas fees fluctuate based on network demand. During periods of high activity, fees rise to prioritize transactions. Users can set a maximum gas price, balancing cost and processing speed.  

### Token Standards  
- **ERC-20**: Standard for fungible tokens (e.g., USDT, LINK).  
- **ERC-721**: Standard for unique NFTs.  
- **ERC-1155**: Enables semi-fungible tokens for gaming and collectibles.

## What Is Ethereum Used For?  

### 1. **Smart Contracts**  
Smart contracts automate agreements without intermediaries. Examples include decentralized lending platforms, insurance protocols, and automated supply chain management.  

### 2. **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**  
Ethereum hosts the largest DeFi ecosystem, offering services like:  
- **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)**: Platforms like Uniswap and SushiSwap for token swaps.  
- **Lending Protocols**: Aave and Compound for interest-earning deposits.  
- **Yield Farming**: Strategies to maximize returns on crypto assets.  

### 3. **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**  
Ethereum is the leading platform for NFTs, enabling digital ownership of art, music, virtual real estate, and more. Marketplaces like OpenSea and Rarible thrive on its infrastructure.  

### 4. **Enterprise Solutions**  
Companies use Ethereumâ€™s blockchain for supply chain tracking, identity verification, and tokenized assets. Projects like ConsenSys and Microsoftâ€™s Azure blockchain leverage its scalability.  

## Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: Key Differences  

| Feature               | Ethereum (ETH)                     | Bitcoin (BTC)                    |  
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|  
| **Purpose**           | Smart contracts and DApps          | Digital gold, store of value     |  
| **Consensus Mechanism** | Proof-of-Stake (PoS)              | Proof-of-Work (PoW)              |  
| **Supply Cap**        | No hard cap (post-Merge)           | 21 million                       |  
| **Transaction Speed** | ~15 seconds                        | ~10 minutes                      |  
| **Use Cases**         | DeFi, NFTs, enterprise solutions   | Peer-to-peer transactions        |  

## Ethereumâ€™s Role in the Future of Web3  

Ethereum continues to evolve as a cornerstone of Web3, the decentralized internet. Upgrades like **EIP-4844** (account abstraction) and **Layer 2 scaling solutions** (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum) aim to enhance user experience and reduce costs. Developers are also exploring **ZK-Rollups** for near-instant transactions.  

### Challenges and Competitors  
While Ethereum dominates the smart contract space, it faces competition from platforms like **Solana**, **Cardano**, and **Polkadot**. Scalability and high gas fees during peak times remain pain points, though Layer 2 solutions are mitigating these issues.
