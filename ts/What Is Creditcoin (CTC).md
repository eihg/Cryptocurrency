# What Is Creditcoin (CTC)?

Creditcoin (CTC) represents a groundbreaking blockchain-based lending protocol designed to bridge the gap between investors/lenders and borrowers through credit-based transactions. Unlike traditional collateral-dependent models, this system prioritizes transparent credit assessment, fostering financial inclusion for underbanked populations. Let's explore its architecture, tokenomics, and real-world applications.

## Key Features of Creditcoin

1. **Interoperable Blockchain Infrastructure**  
   Operates as a cross-chain platform compatible with BTC, Ethereum, ERC20, and Gluwacoin, enabling seamless transaction settlement across ecosystems.

2. **Credit-Based Lending Revolution**  
   Replaces over-collateralization with verifiable credit histories, reducing barriers to entry while maintaining risk transparency.

3. **Decentralized Network Participants**  
   Four core entities drive the ecosystem:
   - **Investors**: Provide liquidity through "Ask Orders"
   - **Lending Pools**: Aggregate funds for efficient distribution
   - **Fundraisers**: Connect borrowers with capital via Credal API
   - **Borrowers**: Access credit opportunities previously unavailable through traditional banking

4. **Proof of Work Consensus**  
   Secures the network while rewarding miners with CTC tokens, ensuring transaction integrity and network stability.

## How Creditcoin Works

### Network Architecture

The Creditcoin ecosystem operates through three critical components:

1. **Credal API Integration**  
   Developers utilize this middleware to deploy decentralized applications (DApps) on the Creditcoin network, simplifying blockchain interaction through pre-built tools.

2. **Off-Chain Credit Scoring System**  
   Maintains flexibility for lenders to implement customized risk assessment models while preserving computational efficiency.

3. **Dual-Token Economy**  
   - **CTC**: Mainnet token for transaction fees and miner rewards
   - **G-CRE**: ERC20 token for vesting and trading, convertible to CTC via a 1:1 hook

### Transaction Mechanics

- **Cost Structure**: Each blockchain interaction costs 0.01-0.1 CTC
- **Fee Recycling**: Transaction fees remain locked for one year before returning to users
- **Miner Rewards**: Initial block reward of 28 CTC with gradual decay
