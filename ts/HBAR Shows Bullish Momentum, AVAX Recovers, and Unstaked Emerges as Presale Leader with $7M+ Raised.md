# HBAR Shows Bullish Momentum, AVAX Recovers, and Unstaked Emerges as Presale Leader with $7M+ Raised  

The cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, with distinct narratives emerging around key projects. **HBAR** demonstrates strong technical indicators, **AVAX** shows signs of recovery, and **Unstaked** disrupts the presale space with over $7 million raised. This article explores these dynamics while highlighting Unstakedâ€™s unique value proposition in a market increasingly driven by utility and innovation.  

## HBARâ€™s Bullish Technical and On-Chain Metrics  

Hedera (HBAR) has emerged as a project with robust technical and on-chain fundamentals. Currently trading at $0.20, the token remains 50% below its yearly high, but its ecosystem activity suggests growing confidence.  

### Stablecoin Growth and Exchange Outflows  

Hederaâ€™s stablecoin market capitalization has surged from $38 million in January to over **$182 million**, reflecting increased DeFi adoption. This growth indicates institutional and retail interest in Hederaâ€™s scalable, low-fee infrastructure.  

Exchange outflows further validate bullish sentiment. Over **$18 million in HBAR** has been withdrawn from exchanges in the past two weeks, with year-to-date outflows exceeding $100 million. These movements suggest long-term holders are accumulating tokens, anticipating future price appreciation.  

### Technical Analysis  

HBAR trades above its **50-day moving average**, forming a broadening wedge patternâ€”a technical signal often preceding significant price moves. While short-term volatility persists, the tokenâ€™s position above key support levels hints at potential upside.

#### FAQ: Why Is HBARâ€™s Stablecoin Growth Significant?

## AVAXâ€™s Recovery Amid Market Volatility  

Avalanche (AVAX) trades at **$23.19**, down from its all-time high of $146.22 but showing resilience. The token recently rebounded from $19.09 to $26.84, consolidating near the mid-20s range.  

### Technical Indicators and Ecosystem Expansion  

AVAX remains above its **50-day SMA ($21.01)**, signaling short-term buyer interest. However, resistance at the **200-day SMA ($26.24)** limits immediate gains. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 58.56 and a positive MACD histogram suggest a gradual recovery rather than aggressive bullish momentum.  

Long-term forecasts project AVAX reaching **$33.36 by 2025** and **$326.17 by 2031**, contingent on ecosystem expansion. Avalancheâ€™s focus on scalable smart contracts and DeFi infrastructure positions it as a contender in the Layer 1 blockchain race.  

#### FAQ: What Drives AVAXâ€™s Long-Term Potential?  
**Q:** Why might AVAX reach $326 by 2031?  
**A:** Avalancheâ€™s C-Chain and Subnet architecture attract developers building decentralized applications (dApps). Continued adoption in DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise solutions could drive demand for AVAX as a governance and staking asset.
