## What Is a Bitcoin Wallet?

A **Bitcoin wallet** is a digital tool for storing, sending, and receiving cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional bank accounts, crypto wallets manage two cryptographic keys:  
1. **Public key**: Acts as an address for receiving funds.  
2. **Private key**: Grants exclusive access to stored assets.  

Losing a private key permanently locks users out of their funds. Research shows **20% of all Bitcoins** are inaccessible due to lost keys, emphasizing the need for reliable wallets.

### Key Considerations  
- **Multiple addresses**: Wallets generate unique public keys for transactions.  
- **Backup options**: Most wallets offer recovery phrases to restore access.

- Ideal for long-term holdings.  
- **Subcategories**:  
  - **Paper wallets**: Physical printouts of keys (QR codes).  
  - **Hardware wallets**: USB-like devices (e.g., Ledger Nano X).
