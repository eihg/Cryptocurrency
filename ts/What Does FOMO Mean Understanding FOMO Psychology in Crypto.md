### Why Does FOMO Occur?

- **Market volatility**: Rapid price movements create a sense of scarcity.  
- **Overconfidence**: Believing one can predict or capitalize on short-term trends.

## How to Overcome FOMO in Crypto  

### 1. **Create a Clear Investment Plan**  
Define your goals, risk tolerance, and entry/exit strategies. For example:  
- **Short-term**: Allocate 10% of your portfolio to speculative coins.  
- **Long-term**: Focus on established projects like Bitcoin or Ethereum.  

Stick to your plan regardless of market hype.  

### 2. **Educate Yourself**  
Knowledge reduces reliance on herd mentality. Study:  
- **Blockchain fundamentals** (e.g., consensus mechanisms, scalability).  
- **Market analysis techniques** (e.g., technical indicators, on-chain data).  
- **Project whitepapers** to assess real-world utility.  

### 3. **Practice Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)**  
Instead of timing the market, invest fixed amounts regularly. This minimizes emotional decisions and spreads risk.  

| Strategy | Benefit |  
|---------|---------|  
| Weekly DCA | Reduces impact of price volatility. |  
| Monthly DCA | Aligns with long-term goals. |  

### 4. **Set Stop-Loss Limits**  
Automatically sell assets if they drop below a predetermined price. This prevents catastrophic losses during sudden crashes.  

### 5. **Limit Exposure to Hype**  
Unfollow aggressive crypto influencers or groups that promote FOMO. Focus on reputable news sources like Coindesk or Cointelegraph.
