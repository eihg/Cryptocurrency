## Key Features to Prioritize  

When evaluating wallets, consider the following features to align with your security and usability preferences:  

### Control Over Funds  
Decentralized wallets grant you full ownership of private keys, ensuring no third party can freeze your assets. However, this requires diligent security practices like regular backups.  

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)  
2FA adds an extra security layer by requiring a secondary verification code (e.g., sent via SMS or an authenticator app). While effective, it relies on third-party services for code delivery.  

### Compatibility with Your Needs  
- **Beginner-Friendly Options**: Look for wallets with simplified interfaces and QR code support.  
- **Advanced Features**: Experienced users may prioritize multi-signature support or node integration.
