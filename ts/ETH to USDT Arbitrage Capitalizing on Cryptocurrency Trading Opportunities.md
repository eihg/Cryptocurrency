## Cross-Exchange Arbitrage Mechanics

### Strategy Execution Framework
1. **Price Discovery**: Monitor real-time price variations across exchanges using tracking platforms
2. **Triangular Conversion**: 
   - Buy ETH on Exchange A at $3,000
   - Convert to USDT on Exchange B at $3,050 ETH valuation
   - Withdraw USDT as fiat with favorable conversion rates
3. **Transaction Timing**: Execute within 5-15 minute windows to capitalize on temporary market inefficiencies

### Profitability Matrix
| Exchange A ETH Price | Exchange B ETH Price | Potential Gain |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| $3,000               | $3,050               | 1.67%          |
| $3,000               | $3,100               | 3.33%          |
| $3,000               | $3,150               | 5.00%          |

## Risk Management Essentials

### Volatility Mitigation
Implement these protective measures:
